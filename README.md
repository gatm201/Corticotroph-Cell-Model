# Corticotroph-Cell-Model

This repository contains MATLAB code used to simulate and analyze electrical activity, calcium dynamics, and intercellular coupling mechanisms in a simplified network of corticotroph cells. The model includes electrical and paracrine communication and integrates folliculostellate (FS) cells to assess functional connectivity under spontaneous and CRH-stimulated conditions.

## Overview

- Simulates membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration dynamics
- Explores cell-to-cell communication via:
  - Gap junctions
  - Calcium diffusion
  - Paracrine signaling (ATP â†’ P2X/P2Y receptors)
  - FS cell coupling
- Generates mean percentage correlation from functional connectivity based on calcium correlation

# Getting Started
